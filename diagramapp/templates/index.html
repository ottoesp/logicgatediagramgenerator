                    In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the
                    ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on
                    or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
                    It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass
                    knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very
                    comfortable tunnel without smoke, with paneled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided
                    with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats -- the hobbit was fond of visitors.
                    The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill -- The
                    Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it -- and many little round doors opened out of
                    it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms,
                    cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens,
                    dining rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were
                    all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round
                    windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.

                    This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had
                    lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very
                    respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any
                    adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question
                    without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found
                    himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect,
                    but he gained -- well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.
